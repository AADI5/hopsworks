## Build & development

This application needs to run on the same port as the backend.

To accomplish this, you need to copy the folder 'app' to GlassFish docroot folder.

To access the application you simply go to http://localhost:8080/app.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
